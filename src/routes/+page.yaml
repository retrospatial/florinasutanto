    I am an Interactive Engineer at <a href="https://www.citizencodex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Citizen Codex]{.about-link}</a>, a data innovation studio. My work primarily lies across data journalism, digital humanities, and interaction design. 


    I am interested in using incisive storytelling, visual explorations, and novel data to reveal new truths about how we interact with this world and each other. 


    Previously, I studied Economics and East Asian Studies at Wesleyan and attended the <a href="https://ledeprogram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[Lede Program for Data Journalism]{.about-link}</a> at Columbia, where I got my second start in designing and programming graphics for the web. I got my first tinkering with Tumblr themes when I was 14.


    I am originally from Bogor, Indonesia and now based in Cambridge, MA.

    Where to start!


    I have many hobbies and interests. My most longstanding one is writing: outside of school and work, I love writing fanfiction, short stories, fandom meta, media reviews, music roundups, life recaps, and other longform musings, all purely for fun and not for profit or publication. I primarily write on Dreamwidth, an old-school, no-frills blogging platform where my internet friends migrated to 


    I enjoy playing sports and being outside. These days, I mainly practice <a href="https://pkgenboston.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[parkour]{.about-link}</a> and <a href="https://www.eshcircusarts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">[aerial straps]{.about-link}</a>, with a side of bouldering, swimming, and hiking. I go scuba diving whenever I go home to Indonesia (so beautiful!). I'm a big advocate for bringing back recess into our adult lives.
